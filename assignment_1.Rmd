## Exercise 1
R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

## Exercice 2
```{r}
possible_outcomes <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
outcome_probabilities <- c(0.1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05)
n_data_points <- 400
set.seed(1)
fake_data_points <- sample(possible_outcomes,
                           n_data_points,
                           replace=T,
                           prob=outcome_probabilities)
set.seed(NULL)
fake_data_set <- tibble::data_frame(`Fake measurement`=fake_data_points)
```

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(fake_data_set, ggplot2::aes(x=`Fake measurement`)) + ggplot2::geom_histogram(bins=5, colour="black", fill="lightgrey")
```

Statement 1. pass
  
Statement 2. this assgnment is exactely like the first line, which is most probably
